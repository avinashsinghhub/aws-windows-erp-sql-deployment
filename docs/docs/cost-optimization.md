# Cost Optimization Strategy

- Right-sized EC2 instance (m5.xlarge)
- gp3 storage for cost-performance balance
- EventBridge automated start/stop scheduling
- Intelligent-Tiering for backup storage
- Backup lifecycle transition to cold storage

These measures significantly reduce unnecessary compute and storage expenditure.
